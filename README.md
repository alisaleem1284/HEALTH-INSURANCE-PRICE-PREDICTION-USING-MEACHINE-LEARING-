# HEALTH-INSURANCE-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING-MEACHINE-LEARING-
This project predicts the health insurance cost for individuals using machine learning techniques. The model takes into account personal attributes such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region to estimate the insurance charges accurately.

The goal of this project is to help insurance companies and individuals understand factors affecting insurance premiums and make informed decisions.

Features

Input variables: Age, Gender, BMI, Children, Smoker, Region

Output variable: Estimated insurance charges

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling

Machine learning models used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and other regression algorithms

Performance evaluation: R-squared, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error

Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy (Data manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

Scikit-learn (Modeling & evaluation)

How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/alisaleem1284/Health-Insurance-Price-Prediction.git


Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the notebook or Python script to train the model and predict insurance costs.

Future Improvements

Implement more advanced models like XGBoost or LightGBM

Deploy the model as a web app using Streamlit or Flask

Add feature for users to input data and get real-time predictions
